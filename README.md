# Client-Server-Application

Lab5.pdf has the list of all instructions. The gist of it is given below:
Implement a TCP Server and TCP Client application that can be used to send and receive messages from multiple clients. A separate thread will be used to handle the data received from each remote client. The remote clients continue to send and receive data until either the server or client closes the connection. Server should maintain the list of all the connected clients.
